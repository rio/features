# Rio's Devcontainer Features

These features are my daily drivers when developing systems that are mostly
involving containers and kubernetes. Generally they are tool installers that I
got tired of reinventing every time I move to a different project.

The features in this repository are all tested against the same set of distros
and will always have both an arm64 and amd64 variant.

# Available Features

| Name | URL | Description |
| ---  | --- | ---         |
| chezmoi   | https://chezmoi.io | *The* tool that I include in all my projects. It makes it very easy to pull in your personal dotfiles and instantly transform that last 10% of your devcontainer into the dev environment you expect on every machine! |
| skaffold  | https://skaffold.dev | A tool that helps with your development loop. It can continuously build, deploy and even sync files into already running containers whenever you make changes. Combine it with a tool like entr inside the running container and you have a killer combo. |
| kustomize | https://kustomize.io | Helps wrangling your kubernetes YAML manifests into the different shapes you need. Without templates! |
| gum       | https://charm.land | A tool for glamorous shell scripts. |
| k9s       | https://k9scli.io/ | A fast, reliable and interactive CLI tool for kubernetes. You'll wonder how you've ever managed without. |
| k3d       | https://k3d.io | Gets your local kubernetes cluster up and running fast! Includes some quality of life features such as a container registry, local path provisioner, load balancer and ingress controller. |
| vcluster  | https://vcluster.com | Virtual clusters are fully working Kubernetes clusters that run on top of other Kubernetes clusters. Compared to fully separate "real" clusters, virtual clusters reuse worker nodes and networking of the host cluster. They have their own control plane and schedule all workloads into a single namespace of the host cluster. Like virtual machines, virtual clusters partition a single physical cluster into multiple separate ones. |
